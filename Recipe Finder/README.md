# Recipe-Finder


## Introduction

 Recipe Finder was created to address the present issue of food waste, a problem that significantly contributes to climate change. By offering a solution to help households make the most of their available ingredients, Recipe Finder aims to combat food waste and its harmful environmental impact.
 
## Problem: Food Waste
 Food waste is a significant problem that is contributing to Climate Change. This waste ends up landfills that produces methane, a greenhouse gas. 

## Solution
 After in-depth research, it became evident that helping household know what to eat with their available food materials would help reduce the throwing out of these materials and by extension, food waste. Many households end up wasting food because they have ingredients that are nearing their expiration dates or leftovers that they are unsure how to use. The recipe finder suggests recipes to utilize these ingredients effectively, enabling people to make use of what they already have and reducing food waste.
